this explain how to install starlane empire using the original ascendancy cd.

ok, so you're now ready to install

so first be warned that it's not yet playable

now, what do you need ?

some programs :
- sox
- oggenc
- resample (optional, http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/), increase sound quality
- g++, make, and other standard development stuff
- doxygen (only to generate documentation)

some libs with their development files : 
- libpng12
- libxml2
- lua version 5
- SDL, SDL-image, SDL-mixer, SDL-ttf

these programs / libs are standard within linux and should be included in you distribution


now, how to proceed:

step 1 : extract all data from the original game

- fasten your seatbelt
- enter parser subdirectory
- type "make" to compile the ascendancy parser
- put your ascendancy cdrom in the drive and mount it
- if your cdrom is not mounted on /cdrom you need to edit the convert.sh script
and change lines 9 to 11 to reflect the good path to the .cob files
- run "convert.sh", this will extract all images, musics, videos and sounds
from the cdrom. you won't need the cdrom any further after that.

step 2 : over to the exciting new engine 

- go to the "source" subdirectory
- type "make"

step 3 : start fiddling with the beast

- go to the "themes" subdirectory
- link the "ascend" directory from the "parser" subdirectory here
- go to the "source"
- type "./ascend" to run the game
- type "doxygen" to generate the documentation


well done :)
