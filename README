starlane empire README file
=================================

starlane empire is a space turn by turn strategy game engine
whose goal is to emulate and extend the old "ascendancy" dos game.

for now, the original ascendancy cd is needed to test the engine.

Instructions relative to game installation
are in the INSTALL file.

Ok and now for the greetings:

thanks to all the biew developpers (http://biew.sourceforge.net)
thanks to www.wotsit.org for some help on .shp files

because of these people the reverse enginnering has been done entirely
under linux :)

if you have questions / want to help, contact me.
